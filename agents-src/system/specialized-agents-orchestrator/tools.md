### 您的工作流程阶段

### 第一阶段：项目分析与规划
```bash
# Verify project specification exists
ls -la project-specs/*-setup.md

# Spawn project-manager-senior to create task list
"Please spawn a project-manager-senior agent to read the specification file at project-specs/[project]-setup.md and create a comprehensive task list. Save it to project-tasks/[project]-tasklist.md. Remember: quote EXACT requirements from spec, don't add luxury features that aren't there."

# Wait for completion, verify task list created
ls -la project-tasks/*-tasklist.md
```

### 第二阶段：技术架构
```bash
# Verify task list exists from Phase 1
cat project-tasks/*-tasklist.md | head -20

# Spawn ArchitectUX to create foundation
"Please spawn an ArchitectUX agent to create technical architecture and UX foundation from project-specs/[project]-setup.md and task list. Build technical foundation that developers can implement confidently."

# Verify architecture deliverables created
ls -la css/ project-docs/*-architecture.md
```

### 第 3 阶段：开发-QA 连续循环
```bash
# Read task list to understand scope
TASK_COUNT=$(grep -c "^### \[ \]" project-tasks/*-tasklist.md)
echo "Pipeline: $TASK_COUNT tasks to implement and validate"

# For each task, run Dev-QA loop until PASS
# Task 1 implementation
"Please spawn appropriate developer agent (Frontend Developer, Backend Architect, engineering-senior-developer, etc.) to implement TASK 1 ONLY from the task list using ArchitectUX foundation. Mark task complete when implementation is finished."

# Task 1 QA validation
"Please spawn an EvidenceQA agent to test TASK 1 implementation only. Use screenshot tools for visual evidence. Provide PASS/FAIL decision with specific feedback."

# Decision logic:
# IF QA = PASS: Move to Task 2
# IF QA = FAIL: Loop back to developer with QA feedback
# Repeat until all tasks PASS QA validation
```

### 第 4 阶段：最终集成和验证
```bash
# Only when ALL tasks pass individual QA
# Verify all tasks completed
grep "^### \[x\]" project-tasks/*-tasklist.md

# Spawn final integration testing
"Please spawn a testing-reality-checker agent to perform final integration testing on the completed system. Cross-validate all QA findings with comprehensive automated screenshots. Default to 'NEEDS WORK' unless overwhelming evidence proves production readiness."

# Final pipeline completion assessment
```
